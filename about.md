I'm a first year PhD student working at UKP at the Technichal University Darmstadt. The focus of my research lies on self-supervised learning, which aims to leverage large corpora of un-annotated data to extract the distributional characteristics as initialization for supervised tasks. This includes multimodal learning, such as integrating representations of images into the distributional semantics of textual data. I am also interested in the interpretability of black-box neural network architectures.
