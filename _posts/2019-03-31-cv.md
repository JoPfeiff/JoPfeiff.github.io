Jonas is a first year PhD student working at UKP at the Technichal University Darmstadt. The focus of Jonasâ€™s research lies on semi-supervised learning, which aims to leverage large corpora of un-annotated data to extract the distributional characteristics as initialization for supervised tasks. This includes multimodal learning, such as integrating representations of images into the distributional semantics of textual data. Another focus of his research is on unsupervised machine translation, which leverages large corpora of unlinked multi-lingual text documents. His most recent work is on the interpretability of black-box neural network architectures. Here, he extracts abstract rationales from neural classification models using a pre-trained autoencoder to better understand what deep networks like to read.
